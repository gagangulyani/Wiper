# Wiper

### Wipe your current directory's files in one go!

## What does it do?

- It wipes out every file present in current working directory. It doesn't crawl into any subdirectory.

- In case of any errors during Wiping, an _errors.log_ will be created for all errors.

- **[Optional]** _Self Destruct_ Feature is available for deleting the script after wiping is completed.

- **Note:** Wiper will **corrupt** Binary files as it completely wipes out data and just leaves the file name.

## Requirements:

    Python 3.8.3 or above

## Usage:

```
    python3 wiper.py
```

I made this script for fun and refreshing my Python 3 knowledge so use it at your own risk.

*Feel free to modify it* according to your needs.


**P.s. Don't wipe out anyone else's data lol. I'll not be responsible in case you get into trouble cause of it**
